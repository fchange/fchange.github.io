*上一次更新于二月19号， 2018年* -- 看一看web页面上的 About Us  页，是一件我很乐意花上很久时间做的事。
为什么呢？因为一个好的 About Us 页是多么的来之不易啊。
它们普遍是无聊的，以及有很自私 -- 全是关于me me me，us us us.还要强调它们对于你（们）的商业至关重要。实际上，大部分人在开始认真的使用你时第一个看的地方也是那里。如果你做错了，你可能让用户轻易失去兴趣却又毫不知情。
在这篇文章中，我将向你们展示我认为是互联网上 About Us 页最好的12个例子。我将逐一介绍它们，并向您展示它们的优点。
# 一个好的 About Us 页应该包括哪些?
我会在这篇文章的开头排列让 About Us 页变得令人惊讶的方式。原因是，有些 About Us 页看起来很神奇，但其实内容却很糟糕，而另一些页面看起来很糟糕，但却又能立即吸引你的注意力。我在此列出清单，那些令人吃惊的 About Us 页是基于以下方式:
- 讲明要点

首先且至关重要的是， 一个 About Us 页必须要有一个观点。除非内容和布局触及“目标”，否则其他的一切都是无用的。这个目标是告诉用户你是谁，告诉他们你能为他们做什么，或者你为别人做了什么。
- 快速将你引导到有用的内容或人

有些 About Us 页自始至终都在谈论公司做了什么，而对员工则只字不提。有些则恰恰相反。好的页面应该知道你为什么在页面上，以及你想快速找到什么。
- 给出切实有效的案例

一个好的 About Us 页总是需要提到一些过去的成功案例，成就，社会认同等等。给出具体的例子说明为什么你的网站或博客值得一读才是这些页面最重要的功能。
- 包含一个电子邮件订阅表单

自从我写这篇文章，我在我的 About 页上添加了一个电子邮件订阅表单，并看到了一个非常成功的订阅率。似乎人们在阅读你的时候都想订阅你!

我不想在这里讲太多的细节，因为我将在我们浏览页面时讨论每个页面的优点。我希望利用这篇文章向你展示我认为你应该在自己的页面上做什么。
# 互联网上最好的 About Us 页（们）
让我们直接进入并看一看这些 About Us 页。像往常一样，如果你有任何其他建议，或者我有什么纰漏请留下你的评论，让我知道。更重要的是，如果你不喜欢其中的一页，我也很想听听你的看法。哦，这些页面都是很优秀的。我都不能对他们进行排名了。（下面这些如果有人看的话我再接着翻译🤣）

### 1. Copyblogger
![copyblogger](/blogimg/AboutMe/copyblogger_about.png)
Let’s start with Brian Clark the Copyblogger. As you can see from the screen shot it starts out by talking about others, not himself.

How different and refreshing it is from the usual, “I am so and so and I am doing such and such”. The Copyblogger about page is all about you and what you will learn from his website. It isn’t until way down the page that he actually introduces who he is.

Most “experts” start their about pages talking about themselves. Here Clark gives reasons why his blog will help you. What this does is actually give his following credentials more weight because you are curious as to who is providing all this amazing value. Rather than talking about how good he is, he lets his examples talk for him.

### 2. Problogger
![problogger](/blogimg/AboutMe/problogger_about.png)
Darren Rowse has one of the most popular About Us pages on the internet. Why? Because a lot of people go to his website to find out how to actually write an About Us page.

The thing about Darren is that he is his own brand. People love him and become very loyal to the Problogger brand not so much because of its excellent content, but because Darren is a constant voice of guidance and support. His About Us page echoes this personal branding with a story based introduction followed with paragraphs on how you can get the most out of the site and his content.

If I could make one suggestion for Darren it would be to include more of his amazing press. He’s been mentioned in dozens of newspapers and even been featured on prime time news here in Australia. That is incredible credibility for all the newcomers finding his site.

### 3. Tim Ferriss

We all know Tim Ferriss from his 4 Hour Work Week and now his new 4 Hour Body. His blog is a constant source of inspiration for thrill seekers (and slackers) everywhere. The About page starts with a quote that sums up the whole persona of Tim and his site:

“Tim is Indiana Jones for the digital age. I’ve already used his advice to go spearfishing on remote islands and ski the best hidden slopes of Argentina. Simply put, do what he says and you can live like a millionaire.” -Albert Pope, Derivatives Trading, UBS World Headquarters

Tim’s About Us page is written in the third person and done to great effect. It is a good way of being able to list his myriad of achievements without sounding like a bragging private school kid. The focus of his page is references – social proof coming from some of the most popular news stations and magazines around the world. Read this page and you are certain to go on and check out the blog.

### 4. Moz

MOZ
![MOZ](/blogimg/AboutMe/moz_about.png)
Moz is a net famous search engine optimization company that has an amazing blog and an even more amazing set of products that help you get more traffic to your website. Their About Us page is one of the more robust examples in this list but instead of detracting from the message the extra content gives it a lot of authority.

The main focus of their About Page is a timeline graphic that takes you back through their history and details some achievements, challenges and major dates of the company. This gives a real sense of stability and gives you the idea that Moz will be around for a long time.

A major advantage of this type of About Page is that the timeline lets you feel part of their story. You know where you’re slotting in and you feel like it’s transparent.

### 5. The White House
![andrew reifman](/blogimg/AboutMe/whitehouse_about.png)
The White House is a fantastic example of an About Page that makes staff and organization members appear more approachable. There is a heavy emphasis on the story of the President and other main members and this really makes you want to dive deeper into their histories and policies.

The stories all intertwine to make a clear message about the goals that the Government are trying to achieve. Whether you agree or not, you get somewhat swept up in it all. Stories are a powerful way to convey ideas and should play an important part in any About Page.

### 6. Mail Chimp
![mail chimp](/blogimg/AboutMe/mailchimp_about.jpg)
We all know Mail Chimp. Their users hijacked my article about why Aweber is the best for email delivery. But I’m not bitter. And I’m still with Aweber.

This is a great example of an About Page because it mixes the warmth of the staff photos with some actual business. It’s actually a clever little pre-sales page. They give you one paragraph about themselves and then say:

But enough about us—let’s talk about you. Whether you own a business or manage email newsletters for clients, you need an email–marketing service that takes care of the complicated stuff so you can focus on your job.

There is also a focus on other elements of the company away from their main services like community engagement and culture. This can do wonders for making your big company feel more “human” and down to Earth.

### 7. Tumblr
![tumblr](/blogimg/AboutMe/tumblr_about.jpg)
Okay I’m just going to say it. Tumblr’s About Us page is probably the best of the lot. It is perfect. It is what you want to achieve when you set out to craft an amazing About Us page that captivates your readers, gets them hooked in to your ideas and still tells them the nitty gritty about who you are.

Check out the page and you will see the first part devoted to mass social proof – stats of how many people are using the service. Then you get high definition photography of the people and the offices followed by 36 words that make up the sharpest concept copy you will ever read.

Scroll down further, however, and you see something interesting. They let other brands tell you what Tumblr is. They have sound bites from the New York Times, Forbes and Business Week telling you what Tumblr does and why it does it so well. The chosen quotes are short but they paint you a full picture of the service.

The last thing they show you is a growth chart. Need they say more?

### 8. Adidas
![adidas](/blogimg/AboutMe/adidas_about.png)
A dream to make the best sports shoes possible. That’s where you start on the Adidas About Us page. From their they launch you in to a graphical journey through the company’s history. This is a very cool and unique way to show people what your company is about but I do have a few problems with it.

Firstly, it probably wouldn’t work on a phone. Secondly, those things can be kind of annoying when you are looking to scan information quickly. But when you are a shoe company worth hundreds of millions of dollars I doubt it matter to much about what your About Us page does. You can afford to be innovative.

What you need to take away from this one is that super freaky graphics can be an incredible user experience or they can be a downfall. If you use them I suggest that you make it only a part of the page, not the whole page. That way you ensure that people still get something if the graphics fail to deliver.

### 9. Twitter
![twitter](/blogimg/AboutMe/twitter_about.jpg)
The Twitter About Page is a laser-focused sales pitch for their entire brand. It’s all about immediacy and what is happening in the world right now.

The main feature is a big photo of a celebrity like Barack Obama or Kanye West and then you’ll stumble down to a section that shows you some of the main events going on in the world right now. This is very clever because it gives you a feeling of missing out – a very powerful marketing tool and something that humans hate.

If you can use your About Page to show how others are engaging with your brand and make them feel like missing out would be a mistake then you’ll go a long way to developing engagement.

### 10. National Geographic Magazine
![National geographic](/blogimg/AboutMe/netgao_about.jpg)
National Geographic is one of my favorite magazines in the world. Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated by the photographic stories and amazing treasures that their reporters uncover. And while their About Us page is not the most exciting in the world it does do a good job of conveying the sheer magnitude of things that their organization does by putting things in neat categories.

I wonder if anyone can think of a better way that National Geographic could do their About Us page? Do you prefer the Red Shark theme for it’s clear minimalism?

### 11. Gummisig

![Gummisig](/blogimg/AboutMe/gum.jpg)
Gummisig is a web designer that I am a big fan of and the reason I wanted to show you his About Us page is because it is an excellent lesson in using text to draw the eye in and grab attention.

You might have noticed that hip web savvy people are now creating a trend of using massively over sized text to present a shocking or interesting idea. Gummisig does it really well here by starting with a joke and progressively moving the text size down as it gets more serious. He ends with a bunch of testimonials. I’m not sure why he didn’t get a testimonial from IKEA though as he built their website!

If you want to use big text like this it is a good idea to consult a designer as it can come out looking really bad.

### 12. Bentley Motors

![bentley motors](/blogimg/AboutMe/bentley_about.png)
Anyone out there own a Bentley? They start at around $200,000 so you must be doing alright if you do. And the thing about Bentleys is that they rely a lot on that prestigious image that goes along with the brand. After all, there are plenty of cars out there that are probably just as good and cost a whole heaps less.

The About Us page does an excellent job of creating that magical and illustrious vibe. They use rich professional photographs and enticing copy like:

“The six-time success at Le Mans has made Bentley more than a car – it has come to stand for a way of doing things: with spirit, flair, courage, instinctive intelligence and teamwork.”

The whole point of this About Us page is to get you to feel part of the experience. To draw you in to their way of thinking and acting which is, in fact, their marketing plan and branding. Remember that your About Us page often serves as a point of consolidation – the place where people go to put your whole vision together.
